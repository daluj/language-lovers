These actions turn the five principles into practical steps, creating an immersive and effective learning environment.

  ### Listen Extensively (Brain Soaking)

  - Immerse yourself in the language by listening to it constantly, even if you don’t understand everything. Focus on rhythms, patterns, and standout phrases. This "brain soaking" helps your mind adapt to the language’s sound and flow.

  > Listening provides comprehensible input, even before full understanding.

  ### Focus on Meaning First

  - Understand meaning before worrying about individual words, using body language, context, and visual cues. This mirrors natural human communication, which relies heavily on non-verbal signals.

  > Prioritizing meaning ensures comprehensible input drives learning.

  ### Start Mixing Words Creatively

  - Combine words you know to create new phrases, even if simple or imperfect. With 10 verbs, 10 nouns, and 10 adjectives, you can make up to 1,000 combinations. Babies do this (e.g., "me, bath, now"), so can you.
  - Language is a creative process, get creative and start mixing.

  > Creative mixing treats the language as a communication tool from the start.

  ### Focus on High-Frequency Content

  - Learn the most common words and structures first.
  - **Weekly Breakdown**:
    - **Week 1**: Master basic tools like "What is this?", "I don’t understand", "Repeat that, please.", "How do you say ...?", "What does that mean?"
    - **Weeks 2-3**: Learn pronouns, common verbs, and adjectives (e.g., "you," "that," "give," "hot," "me"). Simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, simple adjectives, communicating like a baby.
    - **Week 4**: Add "glue words" (e.g., "although," "but," "therefore") for complex sentences. These are logical transformers that tie bits of a language together, allowing you to make more complex meaning. At this point you are talking.

  > High-frequency content is relevant and immediately useful.

  ### Find a Language Parent

  - A "language parent" is a fluent speaker who:
    - Works hard to understand what you are saying.
    - Avoids correcting mistakes.
    - Confirms understanding by using correct language.
    - Uses words and phrases you know.
  - This mimics how parents support children learning to speak.

  > A language parent fosters communication in a supportive setting.

  ### Copy Native Speakers’ Facial Movements

  - Watch how native speakers move their mouths and faces. Mimic these to improve pronunciation and sound natural. Feel how it sounds and hear how it feels.
  - You've got to get the muscles of the face working right, so you can sound in a way that people will understand you.
  - Ideally if you can look at a native speaker and just observe how they use their face muscles, let your unconscious mind absorb the rules, then you are going to be able to pick it up.

  > This strengthens the physical aspect of speaking.

  ### Connect Words to Mental Images

  - Link new words directly to images or feelings, not translations. For "fire," imagine the smell of smoke or the crackling sound, bypassing your native language.
  - Everything you know is an image inside your mind, it's feelings. Same box, different path. Connect new sounds to those images that you already have in your brain, into the internal representation.

  > Direct associations make input more comprehensible and memorable.
