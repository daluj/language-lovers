{{% steps %}}

### Step 1: Identify Weak Words
When reviewing, write down words you miss multiple times in a notebook. These need reinforcement.

### Step 2: Meet Your Language Parent
Discuss notebook words and create sentences tied to:
- Past experiences
- Future plans
- Imagined scenarios
- Stories about friends

Write these sentences in your notebook.

### Step 3: Hide Translations
Record translations or notes in your notebook, but keep them out of sight to encourage recall.

### Step 4: Review Regularly
1–3 times weekly, review your sentences. Check translations only if you can’t recall meanings.

### Step 5: Create Flashcards
Turn sentences into **flashcards** with new or surprising elements. Add audio recordings of your language parent for better memory and listening.

## Crafting Effective Flashcards

To maximize retention:
1. **Identify new/surprising elements** in each sentence for flashcards.
2. **Intermediate/Advanced**: Add word definitions to flashcards.
3. **All Levels**: Include audio of your language parent saying sentences.
4. **Review frequently** to memorize content before the next session.

> As you progress, create fewer flashcards per sentence as less content will be new.
