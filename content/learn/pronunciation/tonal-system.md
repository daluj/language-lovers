There are 6 tones in Standard Vietnamese. In the Southern dialect, the two tones “hỏi” and “ngã” are pronounced identically

| Tone Name | Tone Nickname | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Ngang | Flat Tone | This is a flat tone, no melody |
| Sắc | Up Tone   | Straight up, start from medium then go high but has a stop on the top |
| Huyền | Down Tone | Start from flat and go down, straight down |
| Hỏi | Question Tone | Your voice goes up like you are asking a question |
| Ngã | Wave Tone | Similar to question tone but there is a short break in between. In the south there is only 5 tones. |
| Nặng | Dot Tone | Strong, low. On the opposite direction of the question tone. On the way down |

Every word only has one tone and is located above (except 'dot tone' which is located below) main vowel.
