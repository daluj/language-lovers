| 1    | Flat Tone | This is a flat tone, no melody |
| 2    | Up Tone   | Straight up, start from medium then go high but has a stop on the top |
| 3    | Down Tone | Start from flat and go down, straight down |
| 4    | Question Tone | Your voice goes up like you are asking a question |
| 5    | Wave Tone | Similar to question tone but there is a short break in between. In the south there is only 5 tones. |
| 6    | Dot Tone | Strong, low. On the opposite direction of the question tone. On the way down |
