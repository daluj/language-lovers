To ask “where” questions in Vietnamese, use the structure: **Xin lỗi, [place] ở đâu?**

- **Xin lỗi**: Polite way to get attention, meaning “excuse me.”
- **ở đâu**: Means “where is.”
- **Place**: The location you’re asking about (e.g., “nhà hàng” for restaurant).

**Examples**:
- Xin lỗi, nhà hàng ở đâu? (Where is the restaurant?)
- Xin lỗi, khách sạn ở đâu? (Where is the hotel?)

For polite requests, use **làm ơn** (please):
- Làm ơn chỉ đường đến nhà hàng. (Please show the way to the restaurant.)

Vietnamese uses simple verbs for directions, often without prepositions like “to” in English.

- **Rẽ phải**: Turn right.
- **Rẽ trái**: Turn left.
- **Đi thẳng**: Go straight.

**Examples**:
- Đi thẳng, sau đó rẽ phải. (Go straight, then turn right.)
- Rẽ trái ở ngã tư. (Turn left at the intersection.)

Note: **sau đó** (then) connects instructions, and **ngã tư** means “intersection.”
